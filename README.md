# Manatee
Manatee is an automatic .dcignore generator based on common .gitignore patterns found in https://github.com/github/gitignore

It's [lazy and ugly](https://youtu.be/YXm1ICO8Nec), yet functional.

# Usage
1. Run the script
```bash
  ./generate.sh
```
2. Read the results
```bash
  cat ./output.gitignore
```
3. ???
4. PROFIT
